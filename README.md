I'm very new to github so excuse me for my poor use of this webiste, I just wanted to showcase my current skills as a new begginer to python, and how I strive to become a real programmer one day. If you have any suggestions, I'll try to implement them as I would also like to learn more about python and github. Thank you!

(P.S I use AI, specifically Claude, to ASSIST me with my programming, and asking it to teach me things i dont understand. I will NEVER ask it to generate code for me.
